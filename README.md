# approx_Graph_Frechet_Mean

The code provided approximates the Frechet mean of a set of graphs when considering the euclidean distance between the spectra of two graphs. The theory is outlined in **Approximate Frechet mean of sparse graphs with applications to linear regression** with an arxiv link to come.
